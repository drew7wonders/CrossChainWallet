# general-message-passing
solidity code for a cross-chain wallet between Ethereum and Polygon using general message passing. It has functions for depositing and withdrawing funds, as well as mapping for pending transactions and balances. It also has events for each action taken on the contract.

In this contract, deposit() and withdraw() are used to transfer funds between the two chains. These functions check if the message is coming from the correct chain by comparing the msg.sender address with the token address. If the check passes, the balance of the depositor is updated and the funds are transferred to the recipient on the other chain.

The getBalance() function allows users to check their balance on either chain, and the transfer() function allows users to transfer funds within the same chain.

Note that this is just an example, and the exact implementation will depend on the specific requirements of your use case. It is recommended to seek the advice of a professional Solidity developer for a production-ready implementation.
