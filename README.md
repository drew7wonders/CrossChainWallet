# CrossChainWallet
Here is a basic example of a smart contract that enables cross-chain communication between Ethereum, Polygon, and Moonbeam using general message passing.
In this contract, the transferFunds function allows a user to transfer funds from their wallet on one chain to another. The transfer function is called by the destination chain to receive the transferred funds.
